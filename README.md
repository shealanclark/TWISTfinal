The team who collaborated with me on this project are Eric Webb, Alex Windhorst, Westly Elliott, and Jon Martin.

The main learning objective for this project was for us learn how to take everything that we have collectively learned over the semester from various classes and create a dynamic website. This includes learning how to create a database, coding the server-side of the web application, and how to use design to make the application the most appealing and user friendly.

What I contributed to this project was the design element of it. For starters, I created the initial layout and helped design it's functionality. Eric Webb put together the homepage and registration page based on my layout. I then finished all of the styling from then on out for all of the pages. Eric also made a carousel with buttons for the homepage, but I changed the carousel to go through the pictures automatically.

Some challenges that I ran into with this project were with the footer. My footer was showing up new the top of the page and not at the bottom. I gave up at one point because it was taking too long. I had an idea though to use an image for the footer instead and that actually worked. Another problem I had was with styling the "edit" pages of the application. The styling was not showing up at all and I was finally able to figure out that the link to the css was linked improperly. 

Features that we ran out of time doing for this project include having the delete feature functioning, the print schedule for the admin, and having our "sessions" pulled from the database and matched with it's speaker.

I would approach this project differently by making sure that we set up weekly goals and having clear objectives for this project. Another important thing to do differently would be to work out the baseline of the project first before moving on. The project wasn't made very clear to us and it would have been better if we were presented with this assignment from the beginning of the semester.
